## Log (newest first)
- **6.4 - Loan/Chit/Retirement detail fidelity** (`feat/phase6-fidelity`). All three detail pages on the
  editorial shell + grid2 panels wired to live state. Loan: release tracker + conditional collateral/LTV.
  Chit: real ledger + rounds strip (aggregate win only) + net-position chart from cumulative ledger.
  Retirement: projection curve replicating the backend compound formula + contribution split. Adversarial
  review PASS after 2 fixes (chit per-round star removed; retirement split base honest). 181 tests.
  Follow-up 6.5: restore chit auction-what-if calculator (/chit/dividend) as a slide-over.
- **6.3 - Asset-detail fidelity** (`feat/phase6-fidelity`). Editorial shell + grid2 panels (KPIs+progress,
  schedule status-dots, funding stacked-bar, contributors sharebar, members). Log-payment -> slide-over on
  real /payments. Ledger/projection/proof/linked-liability omitted (no endpoint - honest degradation).
  Review PASS (spec + K1/K4/K5). 179->181 tests.
- **6.2 - Shared app.css** (`feat/phase6-fidelity`). Extracted the editorial shell + detail-panel CSS from
  app.html into static/assets/app.css (one source of truth for all app pages). Visual no-op, audited.
- **6.1 - Dashboard fidelity** (`feat/phase6-fidelity`). Rebuilt /app to the mockup (sidebar+counts, rich
  topbar, hero stat cards, grid2 panels) wired to live data; dropped fake RATE; XSS-safe. 179 tests.
- **Live demo re-seeded:** clean realistic scenario on khata_live.db - Devanahalli plot (Rs 22L, 5/8 paid,
  62.5%), Gold loan HDFC (taken), S. Mehta (given), Gold 22K holding, 12-member chit, NPS. Live on :5055.
- **3.5 â Holding detail + sharing** ✓ Holding page + reusable sharing.js panel on all detail pages. Done-gate: value 60000000, member add 201. Phase 3 complete. 116→118 tests.
- **3.4 Ã¢ÂÂ Loan detail** â (`feat/phase3-ui`). Principal/interest/total cards, schedule, entry modal (disbursement/interest/principal). Done-gate: disbursement â principal 60000000. 115â116 tests.
- **3.2 Ã¢ÂÂ Create-plan flow** Ã¢ÂÂ (`feat/phase3-ui`). `/create` tabbed form (asset/loan/holding) Ã¢ÂÂ POST
  /api/plans, installments builder, auth-guarded. Done-gate: all 3 types create 201. 113Ã¢ÂÂ114 tests.
- **3.1 Ã¢ÂÂ App shell + dashboard** Ã¢ÂÂ merged (PR #8). Real `/app`: sidebar, topbar (greeting/base/logout),
  net-worth/paid/owe/owed cards, type-filterable plan list. Client auth guard, XSS-safe. 112Ã¢ÂÂ113 tests.
